Integration point with Django framework_ideas. It expects application DAOs
(named Models) to be placed in `models` module in the package directory.

PCA helps you auto-generate these models from the entity description, but you
can take control of details of the auto-generation process or build them by
hand and only verify compatibility with the entities.
